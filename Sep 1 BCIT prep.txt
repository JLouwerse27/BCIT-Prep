					CONSEQUENCE:
						4.1.1.2.1 You will see everything as natural and be ignorant to the fundamental flaws of this.

		[BAD EXAMPLE!]	You are you, and they are them. Despite the fact that you are both human, you are at the same time both individuals constantly making individual choices.

{Contractions}:
1. "When I am busy" -> When busio
	Suffix -io is from Italian. 
"Io mangio" is the I-form of the verb "mangiare", which means to eat. Since this inflected verb cointains enough information to distinguish it from the other forms such as "Tu mangi", the subject pronoun "io" can be dropped.
Mangiare: Io mangio = mangio
2. Dozenminutely is the contraction of "every 12 minutes", I would have done fifteenminutely or made up a word to represent a grouping of fifteen, but eh. 
3."I'M NOT DOING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW!" 
	This is for by, there is no need for "I", "me" -> NOT DOING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW!
	"The most" is "the majority" or grandest	-> NOT DOING MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW!
